# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work. This project visually demonstrates the step-by-step process of sorting through algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort. By observing these algorithms in real-time, users can grasp key concepts such as comparisons, swaps, and recursion.

The tool is built using **React** for dynamic rendering, with **JavaScript** implementations of sorting algorithms. Itâ€™s ideal for both students learning data structures and algorithms (DSA) and anyone interested in exploring the efficiency of sorting techniques.

## Features
- **Algorithms Supported:**
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Real-time visualization of sorting process
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Color-coded visual representation of comparisons and swaps
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend:** N/A (fully client-side)
- **Libraries Used:** React.js

## How It Works
- The user selects the sorting algorithm from the list of available options.
- The user can set the array size and control the speed of sorting.
- The algorithm runs and displays each step of sorting visually, with elements being compared and swapped highlighted in real-time.
- Once completed, the sorted array is shown.
